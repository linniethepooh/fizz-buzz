# fizz-buzz

Written in Ruby, Rspec for testing

The rules:
- If the number is divisible by 3, the person doesn’t say the number, instead, they say “Fizz!”.
- Also, if the number contains a 5, the player must say “Buzz!”.
- Similarly, if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 a they must say “FizzBuzz!”.
